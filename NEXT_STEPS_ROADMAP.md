## üí° **My Recommendation**

If I were building this as a SaaS product, I'd do this order:

**Week 1-2:**
1. **Multi-Tenancy** (A1) - Can't launch SaaS without it
2. **Real-time Map Updates** (C1) - Enable WebSockets with Pusher

**Week 3-4:**
3. **Enhanced Data Models** (A2) - Assets, Drivers, Trips
4. **Notifications** (A3) - Email + SMS alerts

**Month 2:**
5. **Real GPS Device Integration** (B3) - Traccar setup
6. **Billing** (D2) - Start generating revenue

**Month 3:**
7. **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** (B1) - Scale preparation
8. **Advanced Reporting** (A4) - Business intelligence

This gives you a **production-ready SaaS platform** in 2 months!

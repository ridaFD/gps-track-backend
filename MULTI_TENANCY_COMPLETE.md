- Supports `X-Organization-ID` header for API requests
- Validates user access to organizations
- Registered in API middleware group

### **4. API Endpoints ✅**
10 new organization management endpoints:

```
GET    /api/v1/organizations           - List user's organizations
POST   /api/v1/organizations           - Create new organization
GET    /api/v1/organizations/{id}      - Get organization details

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **1. API Testing:**

```bash
# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@admin.com","password":"password"}' \
  | jq -r '.token'

# Save token
TOKEN="your_token_here"

# List organizations
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# List devices (automatically filtered by current org)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/devices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# Switch organization
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/organizations/2/switch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq

# List devices again (different results!)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/devices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

### **2. Tenant Isolation Test:**

```bash
# Check devices per organization
mysql -u rida -prida@123 gps_track -e "
SELECT o.name as Organization, COUNT(d.id) as Devices
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN devices d ON o.id = d.organization_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name;"

# Expected output:
# Acme Corporation: 3
# Global Logistics: 1
# TechStart Inc: 2
```

## 🎨 **What's Left (Frontend)**

### **Pending: Frontend Organization Switcher**

This is a React component that needs to be added to the frontend:

**Component:** `OrganizationSwitcher.js`  
**Location:** Should be in the header  
**Functionality:**
- Dropdown showing user's organizations
- Current organization indicator
- Click to switch organizations
- Reload data after switch

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { organizationsAPI } from '../services/api';

const OrganizationSwitcher = () => {
  const [organizations, setOrganizations] = useState([]);
  const [current, setCurrent] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchOrganizations();
  }, []);

  const fetchOrganizations = async () => {
    const response = await organizationsAPI.list();
    setOrganizations(response.data.data);
    setCurrent(response.data.current_organization_id);
  };

  const switchOrganization = async (orgId) => {
    await organizationsAPI.switch(orgId);
    setCurrent(orgId);
    window.location.reload(); // Reload to fetch new org's data
  };

  return (
    <div className="org-switcher">
      <select 
        value={current || ''} 
        onChange={(e) => switchOrganization(e.target.value)}
      >
        {organizations.map(org => (
          <option key={org.id} value={org.id}>
            {org.name} ({org.plan})
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Time to Implement:** ~2-3 hours

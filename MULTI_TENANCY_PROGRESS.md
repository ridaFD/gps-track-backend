## 📝 **Quick Reminder: Why Multi-Tenancy?**

For a SaaS platform, multi-tenancy is **essential** because:

✅ **Multiple Customers:** Each customer (organization) has isolated data  
✅ **Data Security:** Tenant A can't see Tenant B's devices/data  
✅ **Scalability:** One database serves all customers efficiently  
✅ **Business Model:** Enables per-organization billing  
✅ **Team Collaboration:** Multiple users per organization  
✅ **Professional:** Standard for all SaaS platforms

**Without multi-tenancy**, you can only have ONE customer using your platform. With it, you can have thousands!

## 🎉 **What You'll Have When Complete**

A **production-ready SaaS GPS tracking platform** with:

✅ Multiple organizations (customers)

✅ Role-based access (owner/admin/member)  
✅ Plan-based limits  
✅ Organization switching in UI  
✅ Professional organization management

This is the **difference between a demo and a real SaaS business**! 🚀
